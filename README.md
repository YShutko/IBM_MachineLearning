# IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate  

This repository contains my work, notes, and projects from the **IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate** program on Coursera.  
The specialization provides a solid foundation in **machine learning concepts, techniques, and practical applications** using Python and modern ML libraries.
